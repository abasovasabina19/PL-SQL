2. Which type of cursor is automatically created by Oracle when executing a SQL statement?
a) Implicit Cursor +
b) Explicit Cursor
c) Dynamic Cursor
d) Nested Cursor
3. What is the key difference between implicit and explicit cursors in Oracle?
a) Implicit cursors are managed explicitly by the programmer, while explicit cursors are managed implicitly by Oracle.
b) Implicit cursors are declared using the DECLARE keyword, while explicit cursors are declared using the CURSOR keyword.
c) Implicit cursors are suitable for multi-row queries, while explicit cursors are suitable for single-row queries.
d) Implicit cursors are automatically created by Oracle for SQL statements, while explicit cursors need to be declared and handled by the programmer. +
4. Which statement is used to open an explicit cursor in Oracle PL/SQL?
a) OPEN cursor_name; +
b) FETCH cursor_name;
c) DECLARE cursor_name;
d) CLOSE cursor_name;
5. When using an explicit cursor in a loop, which condition should be checked to determine if there are no more rows to fetch?
a) cursor_name%FOUND
b) cursor_name%NOTFOUND
c) cursor_name%ROWCOUNT +
d) cursor_name%ISOPEN
6. In an implicit cursor, what is the effect of executing a SELECT statement that returns no rows?
a) The program will terminate with an error.
b) The program will continue executing without any issues.
c) The program will prompt the user to input rows manually.
