**Task 1: Anonymous Block with IF-ELSE**
Task: Write an anonymous block that checks if `v_salary` of employee with `employee_id` 105 is greater than 5000.
If true, print "High Salary," otherwise print "Low Salary."
set serveroutput on;
DECLARE
   v_salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
   SELECT salary INTO v_salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 105;
   IF v_salary>5000 then
   dbms_output.put_line('High Salary');
   else
   dbms_output.put_line('Low Salary');
   END IF;
END;
**Task 2: Data Type Conversion in Anonymous Block**
Task: Write an anonymous block that calculates the `v_duration` in years for the difference between the `start_date` and
`end_date` of the `job_history` for `employee_id` 103.
declare
v_duration number;
BEGIN
select end_date - start_date INTO v_duration FROM job_history WHERE employee_id = 103;
v_duration := v_duration / 365;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( v_duration);
END;
**Task 5: Anonymous Block with NULL Handling**
Task: Write an anonymous block that retrieves the `v_manager_name` of the manager for employee with `employee_id` 120. 
If the manager is not assigned, print "No Manager."
DECLARE
v_manager_name VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
   SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name INTO v_manager_name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 120;
   IF v_manager_name is null then
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No Manager');
   ELSE
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_manager_name);
   END IF;
END;
**Task 6: Anonymous Block with Type Conversion**
Task: Write an anonymous block that converts the `v_hire_date` of employee with `employee_id` 125 into a string format (e.g., '2023-08-15') and prints it.
DECLARE
   v_hire_date DATE;
   v_date varchar2(30);
BEGIN
   SELECT hire_date INTO v_hire_date FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 125;
   v_date:=to_char(v_hire_date ,'YYYY-MM-DD');
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_date);
END;
**Task 7: Anonymous Block with Data Type Comparison**
Task: Write an anonymous block that compares the `v_start_date` of employee with `employee_id` 130 to the current date.
If the start date is in the past, print "Started."
DECLARE
    v_start_date DATE;
BEGIN
    SELECT hire_date INTO v_start_date FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 130;
    IF v_start_date < sysdate THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Started.');
    END IF;
END;
