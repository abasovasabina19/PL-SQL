**Questions:**

1. What is the purpose of a loop in Oracle PL/SQL?
a) To define subprograms
b) To execute a block of code multiple times +
c) To create tables and views
d) To perform arithmetic operations
2. Which loop type repeats a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true?
a) Simple Loop
b) WHILE Loop +
c) Numeric FOR Loop
d) Cursor FOR Loop
3. The `EXIT` statement is used in which loop to terminate it unconditionally?
a) Simple Loop +
b) WHILE Loop
c) Numeric FOR Loop
d) Cursor FOR Loop
4. In a numeric FOR loop, how is the loop index incremented or decremented?
a) Manually by the programmer
b) Automatically based on the specified range and step value +
c) Using the CONTINUE statement
d) It remains constant throughout the loop
5. The cursor FOR loop is used for:
a) Defining a cursor in PL/SQL
b) Fetching data from a cursor and processing it row by row +
c) Joining multiple tables in a query
d) Creating and managing database connections
6. Which loop construct is used to emulate a REPEAT UNTIL loop in PL/SQL?
a) Simple Loop with EXIT WHEN +
b) WHILE Loop
c) Numeric FOR Loop
d) Cursor FOR Loop
7. What is the purpose of a label in a loop?
a) To make the loop run faster
b) To assign a name to a variable used in the loop
c) To specify which loop to exit or continue, especially in nested loops +
d) To define a subprogram within the loop
8. How do you skip the rest of the loop body and continue with the next iteration in PL/SQL?
a) BREAK
b) EXIT 
c) RETURN
d) CONTINUE +
9. Which loop type does not have a predefined exit condition and requires an explicit `EXIT` or `EXIT WHEN` statement?
a) Simple Loop +
b) WHILE Loop
c) Numeric FOR Loop
d) Cursor FOR Loop
10. What is the advantage of using a cursor FOR loop over a regular FOR loop when iterating through a result set?
a) It allows you to define multiple cursors simultaneously.
b) It automatically opens and closes the cursor.
c) It allows you to specify the loop range directly in the cursor declaration.
d) It can handle nontrivial increments in the loop index.
