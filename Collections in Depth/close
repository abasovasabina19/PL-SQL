a) Nested Tables have a fixed size, while Varrays have a dynamic size.
b) Nested Tables use arbitrary keys, while Varrays use numeric indexes.
c) Nested Tables can only store elements of the same data type, while Varrays can store elements of different data types.
d) Nested Tables support bulk operations, while Varrays do not.

a) Nested Tables
b) Varrays
c) Associative Arrays
